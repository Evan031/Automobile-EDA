# Automobile-EDA
A detailed EDA on the automotive industry.

The purpose of this project was to explore the automobile industry. To differentiate between car makes and how their attributes affect performance and the market.

The data being analysed contains not just the car manufacturers but the weight, height, peak RPM etc. Basically a multitude of specs that helped me get a holistic view of the industry.

I analysed and cleaned the data using Numpy and Pandas. I then used Matplotlib to visualise the data.

# My findings were as follows:

* Toyota produces the most models of vehicle 
* The top 6 model variant produces are from Japan 
* Most cars have a 0-risk rating 
* There are more cars with a positive than a negative risk rating 
* Car producers make more front wheel drive cars 
* Normally aspirated cars dominate the market 
* Bigger engines need less RPM 
* Jaguar is the highest performing car out of the major car manufacturers 
* More 4 door cars are produced than 2 door 
* City miles per gallon are lower than highway miles per gallon 
* The more horsepower a car has the less mileage it will have
